Problem Statement

Finance Industry is the biggest consumer of Data Scientists. It faces constant attack by fraudsters, who try to trick the system. Correctly identifying fraudulent transactions is often compared with finding needle in a haystack because of the low event rate.It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Required to try various techniques such as supervised models with oversampling, unsupervised anomaly detection, and heuristics to get good accuracy at fraud detection using Machine Learning and statistical Modelling Tecniques.

Methods and Tenhniques implemented:
ML techniques used are Logistic Regression,Naive Bayes,SVM and ensembled methods like RandomForest and Xgboost.
Multivariate Gaussian distribute is used to detect anomaly in the transactions.
